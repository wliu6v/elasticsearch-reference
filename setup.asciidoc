This section includes information on how to setup *elasticsearch* and
get it running. If you haven't already, http://www.elasticsearch.org/download[download] it, and
then check the <<setup-installation,installation>> docs.

NOTE: Elasticsearch can also be installed from our repositories using `apt` or `yum`.
See <<setup-repositories>>.

== Installation

After link:/download[downloading] the latest release and extracting it,
*elasticsearch* can be started using:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
$ bin/elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------------

Under *nix system, the command will start the process in the foreground.
To run it in the background, add the `-d` switch to it:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
$ bin/elasticsearch -d
--------------------------------------------------

Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp[Java 6] in order to run.
The version of Java that will be used can be set by setting the
`JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

.*NIX
*************************************************************************
There are added features when using the `elasticsearch` shell script.
The first, which was explained earlier, is the ability to easily run the
process either in the foreground or the background.

Another feature is the ability to pass `-X` and `-D` or getopt long style
configuration parameters directly to the script. When set, all override
anything set using either `JAVA_OPTS` or `ES_JAVA_OPTS`. For example:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
$ bin/elasticsearch -Xmx2g -Xms2g -Des.index.store.type=memory --node.name=my-node
--------------------------------------------------
