The indices APIs are used to manage individual indices,
index settings, aliases, mappings, index templates
and warmers.

[float]
== Index management:

* <<indices-create-index>>
* <<indices-delete-index>>
* <<indices-exists>>
* <<indices-open-close>>

[float]
== Mapping management:

* <<indices-put-mapping>>
* <<indices-delete-mapping>>
* <<indices-types-exists>>

[float]
== Alias management:
* <<indices-aliases>>

[float]
== Index settings:
* <<indices-update-settings>>
* <<indices-get-settings>>
* <<indices-analyze>>
* <<indices-templates>>
* <<indices-warmers>>

[float]
== Monitoring:
* <<indices-status>>
* <<indices-stats>>
* <<indices-segments>>

[float]
== Status management:
* <<indices-clearcache>>
* <<indices-refresh>>
* <<indices-flush>>
* <<indices-optimize>>
* <<indices-gateway-snapshot>>
