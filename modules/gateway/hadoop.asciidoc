=== Hadoop Gateway

*The hadoop gateway is deprecated and will be removed in a future
version. Please use the
<<modules-gateway-local,local gateway>>
instead.*

The hadoop (HDFS) based gateway stores the cluster meta and indices data
in hadoop. Hadoop support is provided as a plugin and installing is
explained https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-hadoop[here] or
downloading the hadoop plugin and placing it under the `plugins`
directory. Here is an example config to enable it:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
gateway:
    type: hdfs
    hdfs:
        uri: hdfs://myhost:8022
--------------------------------------------------

==== Settings

The hadoop gateway requires two simple settings. The `gateway.hdfs.uri`
controls the URI to connect to the hadoop cluster, for example:
`hdfs://myhost:8022`. The `gateway.hdfs.path` controls the path under
which the gateway will store the data.

[float]
==== concurrent_streams

The `gateway.hdfs.concurrent_streams` allow to throttle the number of
streams (per node) opened against the shared gateway performing the
snapshot operation. It defaults to `5`.
