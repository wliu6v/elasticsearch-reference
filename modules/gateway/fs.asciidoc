=== Shared FS Gateway

*The shared FS gateway is deprecated and will be removed in a future
version. Please use the
<<modules-gateway-local,local gateway>>
instead.*

The file system based gateway stores the cluster meta data and indices
in a *shared* file system. Note, since it is a distributed system, the
file system should be shared between all different nodes. Here is an
example config to enable it:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
gateway:
    type: fs
--------------------------------------------------

==== location

The location where the gateway stores the cluster state can be set using
the `gateway.fs.location` setting. By default, it will be stored under
the `work` directory. Note, the `work` directory is considered a
temporal directory with ElasticSearch (meaning it is safe to `rm -rf`
it), the default location of the persistent gateway in work intentional,
*it should be changed*.

When explicitly specifying the `gateway.fs.location`, each node will
append its `cluster.name` to the provided location. It means that the
location provided can safely support several clusters.

==== concurrent_streams

The `gateway.fs.concurrent_streams` allow to throttle the number of
streams (per node) opened against the shared gateway performing the
snapshot operation. It defaults to `5`.
