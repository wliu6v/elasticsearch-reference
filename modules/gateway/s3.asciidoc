=== S3 Gateway

*The S3 gateway is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Please use the <<modules-gateway-local,local
gateway>> instead.*

S3 based gateway allows to do long term reliable async persistency of
the cluster state and indices directly to Amazon S3. Here is how it can
be configured:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
cloud:
    aws:
        access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
        secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br


gateway:
    type: s3
    s3:
        bucket: bucket_name
--------------------------------------------------

Youâ€™ll need to install the `cloud-aws` plugin, by running
`bin/plugin install cloud-aws` before (re)starting elasticsearch.

The following are a list of settings (prefixed with `gateway.s3`) that
can further control the S3 gateway:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Description
|`chunk_size` |Big files are broken down into chunks (to overcome AWS 5g
limit and use concurrent snapshotting). Default set to `100m`.
|=======================================================================

[float]
==== concurrent_streams

The `gateway.s3.concurrent_streams` allow to throttle the number of
streams (per node) opened against the shared gateway performing the
snapshot operation. It defaults to `5`.

[float]
==== Region

The `cloud.aws.region` can be set to a region and will automatically use
the relevant settings for both `ec2` and `s3`. The available values are:
`us-east-1`, `us-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`, `eu-west-1`.
