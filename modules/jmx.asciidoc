== JMX

[float]
=== REMOVED AS OF v0.90

Use the stats APIs instead.

The JMX module exposes node information through
http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/[JMX].
JMX can be used by either
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JConsole[jconsole] or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisualVM[VisualVM].

Exposed JMX data include both node level information, as well as
instantiated index and shard on specific node. This is a work in
progress with each version exposing more information.

[float]
=== jmx.domain

The domain under which the JMX will register under can be set using
`jmx.domain` setting. It defaults to `{elasticsearch}`.

[float]
=== jmx.create_connector

An RMI connector can be started to accept JMX requests. This can be
enabled by setting `jmx.create_connector` to `true`. An RMI connector
does come with its own overhead, make sure you really need it.

When an RMI connector is created, the `jmx.port` setting provides a port
range setting for the ports the rmi connector can open on. By default,
it is set to `9400-9500`.
