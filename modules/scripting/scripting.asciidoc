[[modules-scripting]]
== Scripting

The scripting module enables you to use scripts to evaluate custom
expressions. For example, you could use a script to return "script fields"
as part of a search request or evaluate a custom score for a query.

TIP: Elasticsearch now has a built-in scripting language called _Painless_
that provides a more secure alternative for implementing
scripts for Elasticsearch. We encourage you to try it out--
for more information, see <<modules-scripting-painless, Painless Scripting Language>>.

The default scripting language is http://groovy-lang.org/[groovy] 
(http://mvel.codehaus.org/[mvel] was the default in 1.3.x and earlier). 

Additional `lang` plugins enable you to run scripts written in other languages. 
Everywhere a script can be used, you can include a `lang` parameter
to specify the language of the script. Plugins are available for following languages:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Language   |Sandboxed |Required plugin
|groovy     |no        |built-in
|expression |yes       |built-in
|mustache   |yes       |built-in
|painless   |yes       |built-in (module)
|javascript |no        |{plugins}/lang-javascript.html[elasticsearch-lang-javascript]
|python     |no        |{plugins}/lang-python.html[elasticsearch-lang-python]
|=======================================================================

.Groovy dynamic scripting off by default from v1.4.3
[IMPORTANT]
===================================================

Groovy dynamic scripting is off by default. This prevents Groovy scripts
from being accepted as part of a request or retrieved from the 
`.scripts` index. You can still use Groovy file scripts stored in 
the `config/scripts/` directory on every node.

To convert an inline script to a file-based script, save the contents
of the `inline` field to a file with the `.groovy` extension and
store it in the `config/scripts` directory on every data node in your
cluster. 

For example, if you have the following inline script:

[source,js]
-----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "script_fields": {
        "my_field": {
            "inline": "1 + my_var",
            "params": {
              "my_var": 2
            }
        }
    }
}
-----------------------------------

Save `1 + my_var` in a file called `config/scripts/my_script.groovy`.

To use the script in a request, specify its name (without the `.groovy` extension) in the `file` field:

[source,js]
-----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "script_fields": {
        "my_field": {
            "script": {
                "file": "my_script",
                "params": {
                    "my_var": 2
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
-----------------------------------

===================================================

[float]
=== File-based Scripts

To increase security, Elasticsearch does not allow you to specify scripts for
non-sandboxed languages with a request. Instead, scripts must be placed in the
`scripts` directory inside the configuration directory (the directory where
elasticsearch.yml is). The default location of this `scripts` directory can be
changed by setting `path.scripts` in elasticsearch.yml. Scripts placed into
this directory will automatically be picked up and be available to be used.
Once a script has been placed in this directory, it can be referenced by name.
For example, a script called `calculate-score.groovy` can be referenced in a
request like this:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
$ tree config
config
├── elasticsearch.yml
├── logging.yml
└── scripts
    └── calculate-score.groovy
--------------------------------------------------

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
$ cat config/scripts/calculate-score.groovy
log(_score * 2) + my_modifier
--------------------------------------------------

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_search -d '{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "body": "foo"
        }
      },
      "functions": [
        {
          "script_score": {
            "script": {
              "lang": "groovy",
              "file": "calculate-score",
              "params": {
                "my_modifier": 8
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}'
--------------------------------------------------

The name of the script is derived from the hierarchy of directories it
exists under, and the file name without the lang extension. For example,
a script placed under `config/scripts/group1/group2/test.py` will be
named `group1_group2_test`.

[float]
[[modules-scripting-stored-scripts]]
=== Stored Scripts
Elasticsearch allows you to store scripts in the cluster state.
There are REST endpoints to manage stored scripts as follows:

Requests to the scripts endpoint look like :
[source,js]
-----------------------------------
/_scripts/{lang}/{id}
-----------------------------------
Where the `lang` part is the language the script is in and the `id` part is the id
of the script.

[source,js]
-----------------------------------
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_scripts/groovy/calculateScore -d '{
     "script": "log(_score * 2) + my_modifier"
}'
-----------------------------------

This will store the script under the `calculateScore` in the cluster
state.

This script can be accessed at query time by using the `id` and `lang` script parameters:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_search -d '{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "body": "foo"
        }
      },
      "functions": [
        {
          "script_score": {
            "script": {
              "id": "calculateScore",
              "lang" : "groovy",
              "params": {
                "my_modifier": 8
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}'
--------------------------------------------------

The script can be viewed by:
[source,js]
-----------------------------------
curl -XGET localhost:9200/_scripts/groovy/calculateScore
-----------------------------------

This is rendered as:

[source,js]
-----------------------------------
'{
     "script": "log(_score * 2) + my_modifier"
}'
-----------------------------------

Stored scripts can be deleted by:
[source,js]
-----------------------------------
curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_scripts/groovy/calculateScore
-----------------------------------

NOTE: The size of stored scripts is limited to 65535 bytes. This can be changed by setting `script.max_size_in_bytes`
setting to increase that soft limit, but if scripts are really large then alternatives like native scripts should be considered.

[float]
[[enable-dynamic-scripting]]
=== Enabling dynamic scripting

We recommend running Elasticsearch behind an application or proxy, which
protects Elasticsearch from the outside world. If users are allowed to run
inline scripts (even in a search request) or indexed scripts, then they have
the same access to your box as the user that Elasticsearch is running as. For
this reason dynamic scripting is allowed only for sandboxed languages by default.

First, you should not run Elasticsearch as the `root` user, as this would allow
a script to access or do *anything* on your server, without limitations. Second,
you should not expose Elasticsearch directly to users, but instead have a proxy
application inbetween. If you *do* intend to expose Elasticsearch directly to
your users, then you have to decide whether you trust them enough to run scripts
on your box or not.

It is possible to enable scripts based on their source, for
every script engine, through the following settings that need to be added to the
`config/elasticsearch.yml` file on every node.

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.inline: true
script.stored: true

-----------------------------------

While this still allows execution of named scripts provided in the config, or
_native_ Java scripts registered through plugins, it also allows users to run
arbitrary scripts via the API. Instead of sending the name of the file as the
script, the body of the script can be sent instead or retrieved from the
cluster state if previously stored.

There are three possible configuration values for any of the fine-grained
script settings:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Value |Description
| `false` |scripting is turned off completely, in the context of the setting being set.
| `true`  |scripting is turned on, in the context of the setting being set.
| `sandbox` |scripts may be executed only for languages that are sandboxed
|=======================================================================

The default values are the following:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.inline: sandbox
script.stored: sandbox
script.file: true

-----------------------------------

NOTE: Global scripting settings affect the `mustache` scripting language.
<<search-template,Search templates>> internally use the `mustache` language,
and will still be enabled by default as the `mustache` engine is sandboxed,
but they will be enabled/disabled according to fine-grained settings
specified in `elasticsearch.yml`.

It is also possible to control which operations can execute scripts. The
supported operations are:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Value |Description
| `aggs`    |Aggregations (wherever they may be used)
| `search`  |Search api, Percolator api and Suggester api (e.g filters, script_fields)
| `update`  |Update api
| `plugin`  |Any plugin that makes use of scripts under the generic `plugin` category
|=======================================================================

Plugins can also define custom operations that they use scripts for instead
of using the generic `plugin` category. Those operations can be referred to
in the following form: `${pluginName}_${operation}`.

The following example disables scripting for `update` and `mapping` operations,
regardless of the script source, for any engine. Scripts can still be
executed from sandboxed languages as part of `aggregations`, `search`
and plugins execution though, as the above defaults still get applied.

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.update: false
script.mapping: false

-----------------------------------

Generic settings get applied in order, operation based ones have precedence
over source based ones. Language specific settings are supported too. They
need to be prefixed with the `script.engine.<engine>` prefix and have
precedence over any other generic settings.

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.engine.groovy.file.aggs: true
script.engine.groovy.file.mapping: true
script.engine.groovy.file.search: true
script.engine.groovy.file.update: true
script.engine.groovy.file.plugin: true
script.engine.groovy.stored.aggs: true
script.engine.groovy.stored.mapping: false
script.engine.groovy.stored.search: true
script.engine.groovy.stored.update: false
script.engine.groovy.stored.plugin: false
script.engine.groovy.inline.aggs: true
script.engine.groovy.inline.mapping: false
script.engine.groovy.inline.search: false
script.engine.groovy.inline.update: false
script.engine.groovy.inline.plugin: false

-----------------------------------

[float]
=== Default Scripting Language

The default scripting language (assuming no `lang` parameter is provided) is
`groovy`. In order to change it, set the `script.default_lang` to the
appropriate language.

[float]
=== Automatic Script Reloading

The `config/scripts` directory is scanned periodically for changes.
New and changed scripts are reloaded and deleted script are removed
from preloaded scripts cache. The reload frequency can be specified
using `resource.reload.interval` setting, which defaults to `60s`.
To disable script reloading completely set `script.auto_reload_enabled`
to `false`.

[[native-java-scripts]]
[float]
=== Native (Java) Scripts

Sometimes `groovy` and `expressions` aren't enough. For those times you can
implement a native script.

The best way to implement a native script is to write a plugin and install it.
The plugin {plugins}/plugin-authors.html[documentation] has more information on
how to write a plugin so that Elasticsearch will properly load it.

To register the actual script you'll need to implement `NativeScriptFactory`
to construct the script. The actual script will extend either
`AbstractExecutableScript` or `AbstractSearchScript`. The second one is likely
the most useful and has several helpful subclasses you can extend like
`AbstractLongSearchScript`, `AbstractDoubleSearchScript`, and
`AbstractFloatSearchScript`. Finally, your plugin should register the native
script by declaring the `onModule(ScriptModule)` method.

If you squashed the whole thing into one class it'd look like:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
public class MyNativeScriptPlugin extends Plugin {
    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "my-native-script";
    }
    @Override
    public String description() {
        return "my native script that does something great";
    }
    public void onModule(ScriptModule scriptModule) {
        scriptModule.registerScript("my_script", MyNativeScriptFactory.class);
    }

    public static class MyNativeScriptFactory implements NativeScriptFactory {
        @Override
        public ExecutableScript newScript(@Nullable Map<String, Object> params) {
            return new MyNativeScript();
        }
        @Override
        public boolean needsScores() {
            return false;
        }
    }

    public static class MyNativeScript extends AbstractFloatSearchScript {
        @Override
        public float runAsFloat() {
            float a = (float) source().get("a");
            float b = (float) source().get("b");
            return a * b;
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

You can execute the script by specifying its `lang` as `native`, and the name
of the script as the `id`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_search -d '{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "body": "foo"
        }
      },
      "functions": [
        {
          "script_score": {
            "script": {
                "id": "my_script",
                "lang" : "native"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}'
--------------------------------------------------


[float]
=== Lucene Expressions Scripts

experimental[The Lucene expressions module is undergoing significant development and the exposed functionality is likely to change in the future]

Lucene's expressions module provides a mechanism to compile a
`javascript` expression to bytecode.  This allows very fast execution,
as if you had written a `native` script.  Expression scripts can be
used in `script_score`, `script_fields`, sort scripts and numeric aggregation scripts.

See the link:http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_9_0/expressions/index.html?org/apache/lucene/expressions/js/package-summary.html[expressions module documentation]
for details on what operators and functions are available.

Variables in `expression` scripts are available to access:

* document fields, e.g. `doc['myfield'].value` 
* variables and methods that the field supports, e.g. `doc['myfield'].empty`
* Parameters passed into the script, e.g. `mymodifier`
* The current document's score, `_score` (only available when used in a `script_score`)

[float]
=== Expressions API for numeric fields
[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Expression |Description
|`doc['field_name'].value` |The native value of the field. For example,
if its a short type, it will be short.

|`doc['field_name'].empty` |A boolean indicating if the field has no
values within the doc.

|`doc['field_name'].min()` |The minimum value of the field in this document.

|`doc['field_name'].max()` |The maximum value of the field in this document.

|`doc['field_name'].median()` |The median value of the field in this document.

|`doc['field_name'].avg()` |The average of the values in this document.

|`doc['field_name'].sum()` |The sum of the values in this document.

|`doc['field_name'].count()` |The number of values in this document.
|=======================================================================

When a document is missing the field completely, by default the value will be treated as `0`.
You can treat it as another value instead, e.g. `doc['myfield'].empty ? 100 : doc['myfield'].value`

When a document has multiple values for the field, by default the minimum value is returned.
You can choose a different value instead, e.g. `doc['myfield'].sum()`.

When a document is missing the field completely, by default the value will be treated as `0`.

Boolean fields are exposed as numerics, with `true` mapped to `1` and `false` mapped to `0`. 
For example: `doc['on_sale'] ? doc['price'] * 0.5 : doc['price']`

[float]
=== Additional methods for date fields
Date fields are treated as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 and 
support the numeric API above, with these additional methods:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Expression |Description
|`doc['field_name'].getYear()` |Year component, e.g. `1970`.

|`doc['field_name'].getMonth()` |Month component (0-11), e.g. `0` for January.

|`doc['field_name'].getDayOfMonth()` |Day component, e.g. `1` for the first of the month.

|`doc['field_name'].getHourOfDay()` |Hour component (0-23)

|`doc['field_name'].getMinutes()` |Minutes component (0-59)

|`doc['field_name'].getSeconds()` |Seconds component (0-59)
|=======================================================================

The following example shows the difference in years between the `date` fields date0 and date1:

`doc['date1'].getYear() - doc['date0'].getYear()`

[float]
=== Expressions API for `geo_point` fields
[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Expression |Description
|`doc['field_name'].empty` |A boolean indicating if the field has no
values within the doc.

|`doc['field_name'].lat` |The latitude of the geo point.

|`doc['field_name'].lon` |The longitude of the geo point.
|=======================================================================

The following example computes distance in kilometers from Washington, DC:

`haversin(38.9072, 77.0369, doc['field_name'].lat, doc['field_name'].lon)`

In this example the coordinates could have been passed as parameters to the script,
e.g. based on geolocation of the user.

[float]
=== Expressions limitations

There are a few limitations relative to other script languages:

* Only numeric, boolean, date, and geo_point fields may be accessed
* Stored fields are not available

[float]
=== Score

In all scripts that can be used in aggregations, the current
document's score is accessible in `_score`.

[float]
=== Computing scores based on terms in scripts

see <<modules-advanced-scripting, advanced scripting documentation>>

[float]
=== Document Fields

Most scripting revolve around the use of specific document fields data.
The `doc['field_name']` can be used to access specific field data within
a document (the document in question is usually derived by the context
the script is used). Document fields are very fast to access since they
end up being loaded into memory (all the relevant field values/tokens
are loaded to memory). Note, however, that the `doc[...]` notation only
allows for simple valued fields (can’t return a json object from it)
and makes sense only on non-analyzed or single term based fields.

The following data can be extracted from a field:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Expression |Description
|`doc['field_name'].value` |The native value of the field. For example,
if its a short type, it will be short.

|`doc['field_name'].values` |The native array values of the field. For
example, if its a short type, it will be short[]. Remember, a field can
have several values within a single doc. Returns an empty array if the
field has no values.

|`doc['field_name'].empty` |A boolean indicating if the field has no
values within the doc.

|`doc['field_name'].multiValued` |A boolean indicating that the field
has several values within the corpus.

|`doc['field_name'].lat` |The latitude of a geo point type.

|`doc['field_name'].lon` |The longitude of a geo point type.

|`doc['field_name'].lats` |The latitudes of a geo point type.

|`doc['field_name'].lons` |The longitudes of a geo point type.

|`doc['field_name'].distance(lat, lon)` |The `plane` distance (in meters)
of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].distanceWithDefault(lat, lon, default)` |The `plane` distance (in meters)
of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].distanceInMiles(lat, lon)` |The `plane` distance (in
miles) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].distanceInMilesWithDefault(lat, lon, default)` |The `plane` distance (in
miles) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].distanceInKm(lat, lon)` |The `plane` distance (in
km) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].distanceInKmWithDefault(lat, lon, default)` |The `plane` distance (in
km) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].arcDistance(lat, lon)` |The `arc` distance (in
meters) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].arcDistanceWithDefault(lat, lon, default)` |The `arc` distance (in
meters) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].arcDistanceInMiles(lat, lon)` |The `arc` distance (in
miles) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].arcDistanceInMilesWithDefault(lat, lon, default)` |The `arc` distance (in
miles) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].arcDistanceInKm(lat, lon)` |The `arc` distance (in
km) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].arcDistanceInKmWithDefault(lat, lon, default)` |The `arc` distance (in
km) of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].factorDistance(lat, lon)` |The distance factor of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon.

|`doc['field_name'].factorDistance(lat, lon, default)` |The distance factor of this geo point field from the provided lat/lon with a default value.

|`doc['field_name'].geohashDistance(geohash)` |The `arc` distance (in meters)
of this geo point field from the provided geohash.

|`doc['field_name'].geohashDistanceInKm(geohash)` |The `arc` distance (in km)
of this geo point field from the provided geohash.

|`doc['field_name'].geohashDistanceInMiles(geohash)` |The `arc` distance (in
miles) of this geo point field from the provided geohash.
|=======================================================================

[float]
=== Stored Fields

Stored fields can also be accessed when executing a script. Note, they
are much slower to access compared with document fields, as they are not
loaded into memory. They can be simply accessed using
`_fields['my_field_name'].value` or `_fields['my_field_name'].values`.

[float]
=== Accessing the score of a document within a script

When using scripting for calculating the score of a document (for instance, with
the `function_score` query), you can access the score using the `_score`
variable inside of a Groovy script.

[float]
=== Source Field

The source field can also be accessed when executing a script. The
source field is loaded per doc, parsed, and then provided to the script
for evaluation. The `_source` forms the context under which the source
field can be accessed, for example `_source.obj2.obj1.field3`.

Accessing `_source` is much slower compared to using `doc`
but the data is not loaded into memory. For a single field access `_fields` may be
faster than using `_source` due to the extra overhead of potentially parsing large documents.
However, `_source` may be faster if you access multiple fields or if the source has already been
loaded for other purposes.


[float]
=== Groovy Built In Functions
