[[modules-scripting]]
== Scripting

The scripting module enables you to use scripts to evaluate custom
expressions. For example, you could use a script to return "script fields"
as part of a search request or evaluate a custom score for a query.

TIP: Elasticsearch now has a built-in scripting language called _Painless_
that provides a more secure alternative for implementing
scripts for Elasticsearch. We encourage you to try it out --
for more information, see <<modules-scripting-painless, Painless Scripting Language>>.

The default scripting language is http://groovy-lang.org/[groovy].
Additional `lang` plugins enable you to run scripts written in other languages.
Everywhere a script can be used, you can include a `lang` parameter
to specify the language of the script.

=== General-purpose languages:

These languages can be used for any purpose in the scripting APIs,
and give the most flexibility.
