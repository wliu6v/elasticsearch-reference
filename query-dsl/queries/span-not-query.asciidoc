=== Span Not Query

Removes matches which overlap with another span query. The span not
query maps to Lucene `SpanNotQuery`. Here is an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "span_not" : {
        "include" : {
            "span_term" : { "field1" : "value1" }
        },
        "exclude" : {
            "span_term" : { "field2" : "value2" }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The `include` and `exclude` clauses can be any span type query. The
`include` clause is the span query whose matches are filtered, and the
`exclude` clause is the span query whose matches must not overlap those
returned.
