=== Multi Match Query

The `multi_match` query builds further on top of the `match` query by
allowing multiple fields to be specified. The idea here is to allow to
more easily build a concise match type query over multiple fields
instead of using a relatively more expressive query by using multiple
match queries within a `bool` query.

The structure of the query is a bit different. Instead of a nested json
object defining the query field, there is a top json level field for
defining the query fields. Example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "multi_match" : {
    "query" : "this is a test",
    "fields" : [ "subject", "message" ]
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The `multi_match` query creates either a `bool` or a `dis_max` top level
query. Each field is a query clause in this top level query. The query
clause contains the actual query (the specified 'type' defines what
query this will be). Each query clause is basically a `should` clause.

==== Options

All options that apply on the `match` query also apply on the
`multi_match` query. The `match` query options apply only on the
individual clauses inside the top level query.

* `fields` - Fields to be used in the query.
* `use_dis_max` - Boolean indicating to either create a `dis_max` query
or a `bool` query. Defaults to `true`.
* `tie_breaker` - Multiplier value to balance the scores between lower
and higher scoring fields. Only applicable when `use_dis_max` is set to
true. Defaults to `0.0`.

The query accepts all the options that a regular `match` query accepts.

==== Boosting

The `multi_match` query supports field boosting via `^` notation in the
fields json field.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "multi_match" : {
    "query" : "this is a test",
    "fields" : [ "subject^2", "message" ]
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In the above example hits in the `subject` field are 2 times more
important than in the `message` field.
