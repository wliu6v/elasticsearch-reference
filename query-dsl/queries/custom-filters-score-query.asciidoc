=== Custom Filters Score Query

deprecated[0.90.4,Replaced by <<query-dsl-function-score-query>>]

A `custom_filters_score` query allows to execute a query, and if the hit
matches a provided filter (ordered), use either a boost or a script
associated with it to compute the score. Here is an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "custom_filters_score" : {
        "query" : {
            "match_all" : {}
        },
        "filters" : [
            {
                "filter" : { "range" : { "age" : {"from" : 0, "to" : 10} } },
                "boost" : "3"
            },
            {
                "filter" : { "range" : { "age" : {"from" : 10, "to" : 20} } },
                "boost" : "2"
            }
        ],
        "score_mode" : "first"
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This can considerably simplify and increase performance for
parameterized based scoring since filters are easily cached for faster
performance, and boosting / script is considerably simpler.

[float]
==== Score Mode

A `score_mode` can be defined to control how multiple matching filters
control the score. By default, it is set to `first` which means the
first matching filter will control the score of the result. It can also
be set to `min`/@max@/@total@/@avg@/@multiply@ which will aggregate the
result from all matching filters based on the aggregation type.

[float]
==== max_boost

An option to cap the boost value computed.

[float]
==== Script

A `script` can be used instead of `boost` for more complex score
calculations. With optional `params` and `lang` (on the same level as
`query` and `filters`).
