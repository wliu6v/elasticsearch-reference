[[query-dsl-term-filter]]
=== Term Filter

Filters documents that have fields that contain a term (*not analyzed*).
Similar to <<query-dsl-term-query,term query>>,
except that it acts as a filter. Can be placed within queries that
accept a filter, for example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "constant_score" : {
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy"}
        }
    }
}
