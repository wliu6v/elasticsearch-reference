== Filters

As a general rule, filters should be used instead of queries:

* for binary yes/no searches
* for queries on exact values

=== Filters and Caching

Filters can be a great candidate for caching. Caching the document set that
a filter matches does not require much memory and can help improve
execution speed of queries.

Elasticsearch decides to cache filters based on how often they are used. For
this reason you might occasionally see better performance by splitting
complex filters into a static part that Elasticsearch will cache and a dynamic
part which is least costly than the original filter.
