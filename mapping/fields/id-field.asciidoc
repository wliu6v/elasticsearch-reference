[[mapping-id-field]]
=== `_id` field

Each document indexed is associated with a <<mapping-type-field,`_type`>> (see
<<mapping-type>>) and an <<mapping-id-field,`_id`>>.  The `_id` field is not
indexed as its value can be derived automatically from the
<<mapping-uid-field,`_uid`>> field.

The value of the `_id` field is accessible in certain queries (`term`,
`terms`, `match`, `query_string`, `simple_query_string`).

# Example documents
PUT my_index/my_type/1
{
  "text": "Document with ID 1"
}

PUT my_index/my_type/2&refresh=true
{
  "text": "Document with ID 2"
}

GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "_id": [ "1", "2" ] <1>
    }
  }
}

<1> Querying on the `_id` field (also see the <<query-dsl-ids-query,`ids` query>>)

The value of the `_id` field is also accessible in aggregations or for sorting,
but doing so is discouraged as it requires to load a lot of data in memory. In
case sorting or aggregating on the `_id` field is required, it is advised to
duplicate the content of the `_id` field in another field that has `doc_values`
enabled.
