=== Filter

When doing things like facet navigation, sometimes only the hits are
needed to be filtered by the chosen facet, and all the facets should
continue to be calculated based on the original query. The `filter`
element within the search request can be used to accomplish it.

Note, this is different compared to creating a `filtered` query with the
filter, since this will cause the facets to only process the filtered
results.

For example, let's create two tweets, with two different tags:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '
{
    "message" : "something blue",
    "tag" : "blue"
}
'

curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/2' -d '
{
    "message" : "something green",
    "tag" : "green"
}
'

curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_refresh'
--------------------------------------------------

We can now search for something, and have a terms facet.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -d '
{
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "message" : "something" }
    },
    "facets" : {
        "tag" : {
            "terms" : { "field" : "tag" }
        }
    }
}
'
--------------------------------------------------

We get two hits, and the relevant facets with a count of 1 for both
`green` and `blue`. Now, let's say the `green` facet is chosen, we can
simply add a filter for it:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -d '
{
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "message" : "something" }
    },
    "filter" : {
        "term" : { "tag" : "green" }
    },
    "facets" : {
        "tag" : {
            "terms" : { "field" : "tag" }
        }
    }
}
'
--------------------------------------------------

And now, we get only 1 hit back, but the facets remain the same.

Note, if additional filters are required on specific facets, they can be
added as a `facet_filter` to the relevant facets.
