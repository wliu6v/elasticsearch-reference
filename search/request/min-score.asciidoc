=== min_score

Allows to filter out documents based on a minimum score:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "min_score": 0.5,
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Note, most times, this does not make much sense, but is provided for
