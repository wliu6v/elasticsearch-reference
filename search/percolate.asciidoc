== Percolator

added[5.0.0,Percolator queries modifications aren't visible immediately and a refresh is required]

added[5.0.0,Percolate and multi percolate APIs have been deprecated and has been replaced by <<query-dsl-percolator-query, the new `percolator` query>>]

added[5.0.0,For indices created on or after version 5.0.0 the percolator automatically indexes the query terms with the percolator queries this allows the percolator to percolate documents quicker. It is advisable to reindex any pre 5.0.0 indices to take advantage of this new optimization]
