=== Bucket Aggregations

Bucket aggregations don't calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do, but instead, they create buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criteria (depends on the aggregation type) that determines whether or not a document in the current context "falls" in it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document sets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the `bucket` aggregations also compute and return the number of documents that "fell in" each bucket.

Bucket aggregations, as opposed to `metrics` aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub aggregations will be aggregated for each of the buckets created by their "parent" bucket aggregation.

There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different "bucketing" strategy. Some define a single bucket, some define fixed number of multiple buckets, and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process.
