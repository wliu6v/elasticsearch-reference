=== Templates changes

==== `template` is now `index_patterns`

Previously templates expressed the indices that they should match using a glob
style pattern in the `template` field. They should now use the `index_patterns`
field instead. As the name implies you can define multiple glob style patterns
in an array but for convenience defining a single pattern as a bare string is
also supported. So both of these examples are valid:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _template/template_1
{
  "index_patterns": ["te*", "bar*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  }
}
PUT _template/template_2
{
  "index_patterns": "te*",
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE


=== Shadow Replicas have been removed

Shadow replicas don't see enough usage, and have been removed. This includes the
following settings:

- `index.shared_filesystem`
- `index.shadow_replicas`
- `node.add_lock_id_to_custom_path`
