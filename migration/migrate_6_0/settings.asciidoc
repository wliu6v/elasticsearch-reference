=== Settings changes

==== Snapshot settings

The internal setting `cluster.routing.allocation.snapshot.relocation_enabled` that allowed shards with running snapshots to be reallocated to
different nodes has been removed. Enabling this setting could cause allocation issues if a shard got allocated off a node and then
reallocated back to this node while a snapshot was running.

==== Store throttling settings

Store throttling has been removed. As a consequence, the
`indices.store.throttle.type` and `indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec`
cluster settings and the `index.store.throttle.type` and
`index.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec` index settings are not
recognized anymore.
