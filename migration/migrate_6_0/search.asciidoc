=== Search and Query DSL changes

==== Changes to queries

* The `collect_payloads` parameter of the `span_near` query has been removed. Payloads will be
  loaded when needed.

* Queries on boolean fields now strictly parse boolean-like values. This means
  only the strings `"true"` and `"false"` will be parsed into their boolean
  counterparts. Other strings will cause an error to be thrown.

* The `in` query (a synonym for the `terms` query) has been removed

* The `geo_bbox` query (a synonym for the `geo_bounding_box` query) has been removed

* The `mlt` query (a synonym for the `more_like_this` query) has been removed

* The `fuzzy_match` and `match_fuzzy` query (synonyma for the `match` query) have been removed

* The `terms` query now always returns scores equal to `1` and is not subject to
  `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` anymore.

* The deprecated `indices` query has been removed.

* Support for empty query objects (`{ }`) has been removed from the query DSL.
  An error is thrown whenever an empty query object is provided.

* The deprecated `minimum_number_should_match` parameter in the `bool` query has
  been removed, use `minimum_should_match` instead.

* The `query_string` query now correctly parses the maximum number of
  states allowed when
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction#Complexity[determinizing]"
  a regex as `max_determinized_states` instead of the typo
  `max_determined_states`.

==== Search shards API

The search shards API no longer accepts the `type` url parameter, which didn't
have any effect in previous versions.

==== Changes to the Profile API

* The `"time"` field showing human readable timing output has been replaced by the `"time_in_nanos"`
  field which displays the elapsed time in nanoseconds. The `"time"` field can be turned on by adding
  `"?human=true"` to the request url. It will display a rounded, human readable time value.
