=== Packaging changes

==== Configuring custom user and group for package is no longer allowed

Previously someone could configure the `$ES_USER` and `$ES_GROUP` variables to
change which user and group Elasticsearch was run as. This is no longer
possible, the DEB and RPM packages now exclusively use the user and group
`elasticsearch`. If a custom user or group is needed then a provisioning system
should use the tarball distribution instead of the provided RPM and DEB
packages.
