=== Java API changes

==== `setSource` methods require XContentType

Previously the `setSource` methods and other methods that accepted byte/string representations of
an object source did not require the XContentType to be specified. The auto-detection of the content
type is no longer used, so these methods now require the XContentType as an additional argument when
providing the source in bytes or as a string.

=== `DeleteByQueryRequest` requires an explicitly set query

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, delete by query requests without an explicit query
were accepted, match_all was used as the default query and all documents were deleted
as a result. From version 6.0.0, a `DeleteByQueryRequest` requires an explicit query be set.
