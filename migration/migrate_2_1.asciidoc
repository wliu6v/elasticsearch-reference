== Breaking changes in 2.1

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Elasticsearch 2.1.

=== Search changes

==== `search_type=scan` deprecated

The `scan` search type has been deprecated. All benefits from this search
type can now be achieved by doing a scroll request that sorts documents in
`_doc` order, for instance:

[source,sh]
---------------
GET /my_index/_search?scroll=2m
{
  "sort": [
    "_doc"
  ]
}
---------------

Scroll requests sorted by `_doc` have been optimized to more efficiently resume
from where the previous request stopped, so this will have the same performance
characteristics as the former `scan` search type.
