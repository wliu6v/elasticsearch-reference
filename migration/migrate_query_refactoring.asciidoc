== Breaking changes on the query-refactoring branch

This section discusses changes that are breaking to the current rest or java-api
on the query-refactoring feature branch.

=== Java-API

==== QueryFilterBuilder

Removed the setter `queryName(String queryName)` since this field is not supported
in this type of query. Use `FQueryFilterBuilder.queryName(String queryName)` instead 
when in need to wrap a named query as a filter.
