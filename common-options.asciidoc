= Common API Options

== Pretty Results

When appending `?pretty=true` to any request made, the JSON returned
will be pretty formatted (use it for debugging only!). Another option is
to set `format=yaml` which will cause the result to be returned in the
(sometimes) more readable yaml format.


== Human readable output

Statistics are returned in a format suitable for humans
(eg `"exists_time": "1h"` or `"size": "1kb"`) and for computers
(eg `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000`` or `"size_in_bytes": 1024`).
The human readable values can be turned off by adding `?human=false`
to the query string. This makes sense when the stats results are
being consumed by a monitoring tool, rather than intended for human
consumption.  The default for the `human` flag is
`false`. added[1.00.Beta,Previously defaulted to `true`]

== Parameters

Rest parameters (when using HTTP, map to HTTP URL parameters) follow the
convention of using underscore casing.

== Boolean Values

All REST APIs parameters (both request parameters and JSON body) support
providing boolean "false" as the values: `false`, `0`, `no` and `off`.
All other values are considered "true". Note, this is not related to
fields within a document indexed treated as boolean fields.

== Number Values

All REST APIs support providing numbered parameters as `string` on top
of supporting the native JSON number types.

== Result Casing

All REST APIs accept the `case` parameter. When set to `camelCase`, all
field names in the result will be returned in camel casing, otherwise,
underscore casing will be used. Note, this does not apply to the source
document indexed.

== JSONP

All REST APIs accept a `callback` parameter resulting in a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP] result.

== Request body in query string

For libraries that don't accept a request body for non-POST requests,
you can pass the request body as the `source` query string parameter
instead.
